This project was completed during a nine week internship at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory as a part of the DOE SULI program
under the guidance of Jerry Pierre. This project was a subset of the largest ROAM (Robot Operated Accelerator Monitor) project. The ROAM 
project was envisioned as a solution to the challenges to inspecting accelerator tunnels. Currently, inspecting accelerator tunnels 
during laser operation is impossible, resulting in a loss of monitoring information during a significant portion of time. Additionally,
conducting thermal monitoring even while the accelerator is shutdown is not a simple task. Inspection of the accelerator as of currently 
is a complicated, time consuming, and expensive process. 

The ROAM project aimed to use a robotic platform, leveraging primarily OTS (off the self) parts to allows the process of accelerator
inspection to be simplified significantly. This subset of the ROAM project developed an application to monitor, control, and integrate 
an IR Thermal camera with an RGB camera to provide enhanced operator perception of the inspection area. Additionally, the project 
involved building CNN Object Detection and Classification to allow for future autonomous applications for detecting and analyzing points
of interest throughout the accelerator tunnels.
